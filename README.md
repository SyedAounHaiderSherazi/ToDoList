# ToDoList
Console-Based To-Do List Application in C++
This repository contains a console-based to-do list application implemented in C++. The application allows users to manage their tasks through a simple and interactive command-line interface. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, view all tasks in a tabular format, and remove tasks. The application also includes file handling to ensure task persistence between sessions.

Features
Add Task: Users can add new tasks by providing a description.
Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark a task as completed by specifying its number.
View Tasks: Displays all current tasks in a tabular format, showing the task number, description, and status (Completed/Not Completed).
Remove Task: Users can remove a task from the list by specifying its number.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved to a file (tasks.txt) to ensure data is not lost between sessions.
